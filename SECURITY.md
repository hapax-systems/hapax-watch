# Security policy

This repository is operated by a single individual (Oudepode The Operator). It runs in a single-operator deployment with no external users, no auth surface, and no third-party data residency.

## Disclosure path

Submit security disclosures via the Sigstore-signed disclosure channel at:

  https://example.invalid/contact

Email is not published on repository surfaces by constitutional choice. The Sigstore path verifies disclosure authorship via OpenID Connect, eliminating the need for PGP key exchange or private email correspondence.

## Scope

Security reports about deployment hardening, architectural choices, or features absent from a single-operator system (multi-tenancy, RBAC, federated identity) are out of scope; the single-operator axiom forecloses these.

## Response time

Best-effort, single-operator basis; no SLA. Critical disclosures (remote code execution, secret leak in published commits) are addressed in the next maintenance window.

## Past advisories

None to date.
